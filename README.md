water dispensing system is an innovative solution designed to address water wastage, inefficient water management, and hygiene concerns in public spaces. The system incorporates advanced technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, automation, and data analysis, to optimize water usage and promote sustainability. By accurately measuring and 
dispensing water based on specific needs, the system minimizes wastage and prevents overflows or 
leaks. Real-time monitoring and remote-control capabilities enable efficient water management, 
reducing utility expenses and improving operational efficiency.
